               <h2><u>About Me:</u></h2>
               <p>I am a husband, and a father of three beautiful children.  My full-time job is to care for them.  I am also a full-time student.  I am pursuing a career in Web Development with the end-goal of being self employed.  I have been using computer for over twenty-five years.  I remember when America Online first came out; in fact, I can still hear the dial-up tone in my head.  I am passionate of family, learning, and life.  I love to read, teach, and share a common meal with loved ones.  Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me.  Enjoy!</p>

                <h2>Why Are You Taking CIT-82?</h2>
                <p>I am taking this course in hopes of learning how to develope Websites, with the end-goal of working from home while I home-school my children.  I either want to work remotely or own my own home-based business.</p>
                
                <h3>Are You Enjoying Yourself?</h3>
                <p>Very much so!  I have not learned so much in four-weeks in any other course I have taken in college.  The lesson plan is fabulous, and I believe I am on a fast-track to my desired goal.</p>
